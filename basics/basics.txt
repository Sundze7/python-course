NOTES
-------------------------
> python code gets interpreted (by the interpreter) line by line from the top during runtime
> python is case sensitive
> snake casing is used for naming vars e.g my_var
> use tripple quotes (either single or double) for multi-line strings e.g in writing emails
> methods are fxns that are particular to a certain class
> x = x + 3  is the same as X += 3
